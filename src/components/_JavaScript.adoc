== JavaScript
    * *What is JavaScript and its history*
        ** JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that enables you to create dynamicallin updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and more.
        ** History:
            *** 1995 - Eich wrote JS at Netscape
            *** 1997 - ECMAScript 1
            *** 1999 - ECMAScript 3 (baseline)
            *** 2005 - AJAX coined: jQuery era
            *** 2008 - Google V8 Engine
            *** 2008 - Node.js & npm
            *** 2015 ECMAScript 6 (ES2015) - big language revamp
            *** 2019 OpenJS Foundation formed
            *** 2024 ECMAScript 2024 ( 15th Version)

    * *JavaScript Versions*
        ** ES1 - ECMAScript 1 (1997) - First version
        ** ES2 - ECMAScript 2 (1998) - Editorial changes
        ** ES3 - ECMAScript 3 (1999) - Addede regular expressions, try/catch, switch, do-while
        ** ES4 - ECMAScript 4 ()     - Never released
        ** ES5 - ECMAScript 5 (2009) - Added "strict mode", JSON support, String.trim(), Array.isArray(), Array iteration methods, allow trailing commas for object literals
        ** ES6 - ECMAScript 2015 - Added let & const, default paramter values, Array.find(), Array.findIndex()
        **       ECMAScript 2016 - Added exponential operator, Array.includes()
        **       ECMAScript 2017 - Added string padding, Object.entries(), Object.values(), async functions, shared memory, allow trailing commas for function parameters
        **       ECMAScript 2018 - Added rest/ spread properties, asynchronous iteration, Promise.finally(), additions to RegExp
        **       ECMAScript 2019 - String.trimStart(), String.trimEnd(), Array.flat(), Object.fromEntried, optional catch binding
        **       ECMAScript 2020 - Nulllish Coalescing Operator (??)

    * *All about Variables*
        ** var:
            *** declares function-scopred or globally-scoped variables, optionally initializing each to a value

        ** let:(-declaration) 
            *** declared re-assignable, block-scoped local variables, optionally initialiting each to a value

        ** const:(-declaration) 
            *** declares block-scopede local variables. The value of a constant can√Ñt be changed through reassignment operator, but if a contant is an object, its properties can be added, updated or removed

        ** Variable Declarations : 
            *** Creating a variable in JS is called "declaring" a variable. 
            *** Y declare a JS variable with the var, let or const keyword (`let carName;`)
            *** After the declaration the variable doesn't have any value and has to be assigned using the equal sign (`let carName ="VW";`)
            *** Y can assign the value right at the time Y declare it (`let carName ="VW`)

        ** Hoisting
            *** In JS, a variable can be declared after it has been used. In other word, a variable can be used before it has been declared
            *** Hoisting js JS's default behavior  of moving all declarations to the top of the current scope (to the top of the current script or the surrent fucntion)

        ** Variable Naming Rules:
            *** camelCase (variables & functions)
            *** all names start witha  letter

        ** Variable Scopes
            *** Block (with let & const)
                **** Variables declared inside a {} block cannot be used outside of the block
                **** Variables declared with var can't have block scope (automatically global)
            *** Function
                **** Variables declared within a JS function, are LOCAL to the function and can't be called outside
            *** Global
                **** A variable declared outside a function, becomes GLOBAl (var is always global)

    * *Data Types*
        ** Primitive Types
            *** string:
                **** A string (or a text string) is a series of characters like "John Doe"
                **** Strings are written with quotes. Yo can use single or double quotes

            *** number
                **** All JavaScript numbers are stored as decimal numbers (floating point)
                **** Can be written with or without decimals

            *** undefined
                **** In JS, a variable withour a value, has the value undefined. The type is also undefined

            *** BigInt
                **** All JavaScript numbers are stored in a 64-bit floating-point format
                **** JS BigInt is new datatype that can be used to store integer values tha are too big to be represented by a normal JS number

            *** null
                **** The null value represents the intentional absemce pf any object value. It is treadted as falsy for boolean operations

            *** boolean
                **** Booleans can only have two values true or false

            *** Symbol
                **** Symbol is a built-in object whose constrcutor returns a symbol primitive - also calles a Symbol value or just a Symbol - that's guaranteed to be unique. 
        ** Array
            *** JavaScript arrays are written with square brackets. 
            *** Array items are seperated by commas
            *** Using an array literal is the easiest way to create a JS Array ( const arr = [item1, item2...])
            *** Access array element by referring to the index number
        ** Object
            *** JS  objects are written with curly braces. 
            *** Object properties are written as name:value paors, seperated by commas.

                **** Built-in Object
                    ***** JS consists of a bunch of Built-In Objects, the following list explores most of them. Although these built-ins have the appearance of being actual types or classes like in any other OOP, in JS these are only functions that can be used as constructors to create objects of a particular sub-type

|===

                **** Object Prototype
                    ***** Prototypes are the mechanism by which JS objects inherit features from one another. All JS objects inherit properties & methods froma prototype ( Date objects inherit from Dat.prototype and so on with other objects)
                    ***** The Object.prototype is on the top of the prototype chain. And the null-object is on the highest position of this hierarchy.
                    ***** Cannot add a new property to a existing object constructor. To add new property to a constructor, you must add it to the constructor function 

                **** Prototypal Inheritance
                    ***** In JS, objects inherit directly from other objects. Every ordinary object carries a hidden [[Prototype]] slot that points to another object (or null). When you need a property, the engine walks that prototype chain until it finds the key or runs out of links

                **** typeof operator
                    ***** You can use the JS `typeof` operator to find the type of a JS variable
                    ***** The `typeof` operator returns the type of a variable or an expression

[cols="3"]
|===
| Pattern | How it sets [[Prototype]] | Code snippet

| Object literal
| Links to Object.prototype
| const obj = {}

| Constructor + new
| Links to Func.prototype
| js function Person(){}; +
const p = new Person();

| ES class (sugar)
| Same as constructor
| class Car{} +
new Car()

| Object.create(proto)
| Links to proto exactly
| const dict = Object.create(null);

| __proto__ setter (legacy)
| Mutates [[Prototype]] at runtime
| child.__proto__ = parent;

| Object.setPropertyeOf(obj, proto)
| Official mutable API
| Object.setPrototypeOf(dog, animal);

* *Type Casting*
    ** Type casting in JS is the conversion of one data type into another data type. It's also known as type conversion.
    ** Type Conversion vs Coercion

[cols="4"]
|===
| Term | What happens | Who triggers it? | Typical syntax

| Conversion (casting)
| A value is explicitly converted to a different type
| You (the code you write)
| Number('42'), String(122), Boolean(value), BigInt('23842572758275')

| Coercion
| A vakue is converted implicity because the engine needs a different type to finish the operaion
| JS runtime ( spec algoriths like ToString, ToNumber)
| 5 + '3' //'53' +
'3' + '2' // 6 +

|===

        ** Implicit Type Casting
            *** Implicit type casting in JS, also known as type coercion, is the process where the JS engine automatically convertzs one data type to another when operating on values of different types.
            *** This happens without the programmer explicitly requesting a conversion
                        
            *** Case 1 - String + number:
[source,js]
----
let result = '5' + 2;
console.log(result); // '52' (number 2 is coerced into a string)
----

*** Case 2 - Number + boolean:
[source,js]
----
let result = 5 + true;
console.log(result); // 6 (true is coerced into 1)
----

*** Case 3 - Equality comparison (==):
[source,js]
----
console.log('5' == 5); // true
----

*** Case 4 - Boolean context:
[source,js]
----
if ('hello') {
console.log('This runs'); // 'hello' is truthy
}
----

            *** Implicit casting is automatic and can sometimes lead to unexpected results.

        ** Explicit Type Casting
            *** Explicit type casting in JS (also known as type conversion) is when you manually convert a value from one data type to another using built-in functions or constructors. This gives you full controll over the conversion unlike the implicit type casting.
            *** Common methods of Explicit Type Casting
            *** Using explicit casting:
            - Makes code clearer and more predictable
            - Helps avoid bugs
            - Is essential in strict comparisons or data sanitization


*** To Number:
[source,js]
----
Number('123');          // 123 (string to number)
parseInt('123.45');     // 123
parseFloat('123.45');   // 123.45
+'123';                 // 123 (unary plus operator)
----

*** To String:
[source,js]
----
String(123);            // '123'
(123).toString();       // '123'
true.toString();        // 'true'
----

*** To Boolean:
[source,js]
----
Boolean(1);             // true
Boolean(0);             // false
Boolean('hello');       // true
Boolean('');            // false
----


* *Data Structure*
    ** A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data so it can be used efficiently. In JS, data structures help youstore values ( primitive or complex), group data, and build logic for applications like storing user records, handling network data, and building features like undo, queues, etc.

    ** Keyed Collections +
    Used when you need to associate values with unique keys

        *** Map
            **** A collection of key-value pairs
            **** Keys can be any type, not just strings
            **** Maintains insertion order
            *** `let map = new Map(); +
            map.set('name', 'Alice'); +
            map.set(1, 'one'); +
            console.log(map(get(1))); // "one"`

        *** Weak Map
            **** Similar to Map but 
                ***** Keys must be objects
                ***** Keys are held weakly - they do not prevent garbage collection
            **** Userful for associating data with DOM elements or other objects without memory leaks
            **** `let obj = {}; +
            let wm = new WeakMap(); +
            wm.set(obj, 'secret'); +
            console.log(wm.get(obj)); // 'secret`

        *** Set
            **** A collection of unique values
            **** No duplicate entries allowed
            **** `let set = new Set([1,2,3,3]); +
            console.log(set); // Set {1,2,3}`

        *** Weak Set
            **** Like Set, but only stores objects.
            **** Objects are held weakly, meaning they can be garbage-colected if there are no other references.
            **** `let obj = {}; +
            let ws = new WeakSet(); +
            ws.add(obj); +
            console.log(ws.has(obj)); // true`

    ** Structured Data +
     Used to store complex or nested data, often for exchange or serialization.
        **** JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
            ***** A lightweight, text-based format for storing and exchanging structured data
            ***** Common in APIs and configuration files
            ***** `let jsonString = '{"name": "Bob", "age": 25}'; +
            let obj = JSON.parse(jsonString); +
            console.log(obj.name); // 'Bob'`

        **** XML (eXtensible Markup Language)
            ***** A markup language for representing structured data, especially in older systems or certain APIs
            ***** Not native to JavaScript, but can be parsed using DOMParser or XML libraries.
            **** `let parser= new DOMParser(); +
            let xmlDoc = parser.parseFromString('<user><name>Alice</name></user>', 'text/xml'); +
            console.log(xmlDoc.getElementByTagName('name')[0].textContent); // 'Alice'`
    ** Indexed Collections
        *** Arrays
            **** Can store any type (numbers, strings, objects)
            **** Can grow or shrink 
            **** `let arr=[1,"hi", true]; +
            console..log(arr[1]); //"hi"`

        *** Typed Arrays
            **** Fixed-type, fixed-size arrays for binary data
            **** Used in performance-critical tasks
            **** Type: `Uint8Array`, `Float32Array`, etc.
            **** `let tArr= new Uint8Array([255,128,0]); +
            console.log(tArr[0]); // 255`

* *Equality Comparisons*
    ** Value Comparison Operators +
    There are different ways to check if two values are equal, each with specific rules

        *** == (Loose Equality)
            **** Compares values after type conversions
            **** Can lead to unexpected result
            **** ` 0 == "0" // true +
            false == 0; // true +
            null == undefine; //true`

        *** === (Strict Equality)
            **** Compares values without type conversion
            **** Types must match to return `true`
            **** `0 ="0"; // false +
            false === 0; //false`

        *** Object.is
            **** Like `===` but:
                ***** `NaN === NaN` // false, but `Object.is(NaN, NaN)` //true
                **** `+0 === -0` // true, but `Object.is(+0,-0)` //false

    ** Equality Algorithms +
    These are how JS internally performs comparisons. You don't use them directly, but they define how operator behave.

        *** `isLooselyEqual`
            **** Used by `==`
            **** Converts your types before comparing

        *** `isStrictlyEqual`
            **** Used by `===`
            **** No type conversion; strict match

        *** `SameValueZero`
            **** Used in `Array.prototype.includes`, `Set`, `Map`
            **** Like `===`, but:
                ***** `NaN === NaN` // true
                ***** `+0 === -0` // true
                ***** `[NaN].includes(NaN); // true thanks to SameValueZero`

        *** `SameValue`
            **** Used by `Object.is();`
            **** Like `===`, but:
                ***** `NaN === NaN` // true
                ***** `+0 !== ¬¥0`
