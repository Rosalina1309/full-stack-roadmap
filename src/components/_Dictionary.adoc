== Dictionary
    * *Stateless vs Stateful*
[cols="3"]
|===
| Features |Stateless | Stateful
 
| Definition
| The server does not remember anything about the client between requests. Each request must include all necessary information
| The server remembers the client's previous interactins, so later requests can rely on store session information

| Easier to scale?
| YES
| NO

| Example
| REST API with token, Static Website(HTML/CSS), Google Search, HTTP
| Login session with cookies, online shopping cart, chat app, banking websites
 
|===


    * *XML vs JSON*
[cols="1,1,1,2", options="header"]
|===
| Features | XML | JSON | Why it matters

| Stands for
| Extensible Markup Language
| JavaScript Object Notation
|

| Size on the wire
| Bigger - lots of opening/closing tags
| Smaller - no end tags
| Small mesages travel fast and cost less bandwidth

| Parsing speed
| Slower - needs an XML parser
| Faster - one-liner like `JSON.parse()`
| Affects API response time and battery life

| Comments allowed?
| Yes (`<book title="...">`)
| No
| Needed for rich documents

| Attributes for extra info
| Yes (`<book title="...">`)
| No
| Needed for rich documents

| Mixed test + markup (e-book style)
| Yes
| No
| Needed for rich documents

| Namespaces (avoid name clashes)
| Built-in(`xmlns`)
| None
| Lets big specs mix vocabularies safely

| Schema / strict rules
| Very powerful (XSD, DTD)
| Simpler (JSON Schema)
| Enforces exact data shape in long-lived systems

| Typical use today
| Document formats. older enterprise integrations
| Web/mobile APIs, logs, configs
| Pick the tool that fits the project

| Biggest pro
| Rich features for complex documents
| Lean and fat for everyday data
|

| Biggest con
| Verbose and slower
| No comments/attributes, less document-friendly
|

|===

    * *SOAP vs REST*

[cols="1,1,1,2", options="header"]
|===
| Features |SOAP | REST | Why it matters

| Stands for
| Simple Object Access Protocol
| Representational State Transfer
|

| Protocol style
| Strict, well-defined protocol
| Architectural style on top of HTTP
| Dictates how tightly clients and servers are coupled

| Transporz options
| HTTP, SMTP, JMS, more
| Primarly HTTP
| Affects firewall friendlyness and infrastructure simplicity

| Message format
| Always XML (soap:Envelope)
| Any (JSON, XML, HTML, etc.)
| Impacts payload size and ease of parsing

| Contract / interface description
| Mandatory WSDL (strongly typed)
| Optional, typically OpenAPI/Swagger
| Controls discoverability and compile-time safety

| Verb mapping
| Operation names in message body
| Direct use of HTTP verbs (GET, POST...)
| Influences clarity. caching, and semantics

| Caching capability
| None built-in
| GET responses cachable by default
| Saves bandwidth, boosts speed

| State handling
| Can be stateless but often uses sessions
| Stateless by design
| Easier horizontal scaling

| Security standards
| WS-Security, WS-*, SAML, etc.
| HTTPS/TLS plus OAuth 2.0, JWT
| Heavy enterprise stack and lightweight web standards

| Error reporting 
| SOAP Fault envelope
| HTTP status codes
| Familarity and debugging convenience

| Payload overhead
| Heavy XML envelope
| Lean-often JSON
| Performance and mobile-friendliness

| Typical sweet spot
| Enterprise B"B, ACID transactions
| Web/mobile APIs, microservices
| Choose the one that fits your project
